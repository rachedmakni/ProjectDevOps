### DevOps Project
## When fixing an issue you should respect the following order:
#### 1. Start by using the pull command
#### 2. Create the branch of which issue you will resolve
#### 3. When you push your branch into github make a pull request to the main branch
## When commiting your work:
#### Make sure you commit start with either Hotfix/ or Feature/ so it's easier to read
